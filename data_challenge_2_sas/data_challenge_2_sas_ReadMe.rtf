\f0\fs24 \cf0 I worked on this individual project for a data analysis class during the Spring 2020 semester. In this project we were asked to explore a natality dataset and give a presentation on the findings of our choosing. I chose to report my findings on maternal morbidity rate. I have included my sas file as well as the presentation I gave. The data was accessed through a link and should still be live, and I made sure the entire file ran before I added this project. I would not recommend running the sas file as the natality dataset is quite large and takes a long time to run.}
