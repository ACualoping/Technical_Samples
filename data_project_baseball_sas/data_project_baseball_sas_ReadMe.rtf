\f0\fs24 \cf0 I worked on this project for a data management class during the Fall 2019 semester. The project was an open ended data exploration group project. My group and I chose to look at baseball data specifically interested in comparing offensive statistics between the \'93steroid era\'94 of baseball in the 1990s and the 2019 season with allegations of \'93juiced\'94 baseballs. I have included the sas file and raw data. The sas file contains some data cleaning and tables for data exploration. I removed my group members work so all code in the file was developed by me. }
