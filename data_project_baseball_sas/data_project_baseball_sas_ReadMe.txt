I worked on this project for a data management class during the Fall 2019 semester. 
The project was an open ended data exploration group project. 
My group and I chose to look at baseball data specifically interested in comparing 
offensive statistics between the "steroid era" of baseball in the 1990s and the 2019 season
with allegations of "juiced" baseballs. I have included the sas file and raw data.
The sas file contains some data cleaning and tables for data exploration. 
I removed my group members work so all code in the file was developed by me.
