I worked on this individual project for a data analysis class during the Spring 2020 semester. 
This project is fairly self explanatory and we were asked to create a data visualization based on SBA Loan data. 
I have included my entire .rmd file. The data was accessed through a link and should still be live,
and I made sure the entire file ran before I added this project.
