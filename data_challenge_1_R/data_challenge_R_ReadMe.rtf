\f0\fs24 \cf0 I worked on this individual project for a data analysis class during the Spring 2020 semester. This project is fairly self explanatory and we were asked to create a data visualization based on SBA Loan data. I have included my entire .rmd file. The data was accessed through a link and should still be live, and I made sure the entire file ran before I added this project.}
