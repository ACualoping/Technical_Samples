I worked on this project for a Statistical Consulting class during the Fall 2019 semester.
The project was a mock consulting  group project to assist farmers in when to
sell their corn crops based on its progress throughout the growing lifecycle. 
I have included the sas file and raw data used primarily to clean the data so it could be analyzed in excel. 
I developed ~80%-90% of this code and could not distinguish the parts I did not write.
